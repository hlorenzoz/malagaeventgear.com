# List of Google's special-case crawlers


The special-case crawlers are used by specific Google products where there's an agreement between
the crawled site and the product about the crawl process. For example, `AdsBot` ignores
the global robots.txt user agent (`*`) with the ad publisher's permission. The general
[technical properties](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/overview-google-crawlers#crawl-technical-props)
of Google's crawlers also apply to the special-case crawlers.


The
special-case crawlers may ignore robots.txt rules and so they operate from a different IP range
than the common crawlers. The IP ranges are published in the
[special-crawlers.json](https://developers.google.com/static/crawling/ipranges/special-crawlers.json) object. The
special-case crawlers' reverse DNS mask matches
`rate-limited-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com`.


The following list shows the special-case crawlers, their user agent strings as they appear in
the HTTP requests, their user agent tokens for the `User-agent:` line in robots.txt,
and the products that are affected by crawl preferences for the crawler. The list is not
exhaustive, it only covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that
we've received questions about.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution** : The user agent string can be spoofed. [Learn how to verify if a requestor is from Google](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/verify-google-requests).

    [`AdsBot-Google`](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/google-special-case-crawlers#adsbot)
    robots rules, but ignored the global user agent (`*`).
