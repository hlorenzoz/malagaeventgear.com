# List of Google user-triggered fetchers


User-triggered fetchers are initiated by users to perform a fetching function within a Google
product. For example,
[Google Site Verifier](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/9008080)
acts on a user's request, or a site hosted on Google Cloud (GCP) has a feature that allows the
site's users to retrieve an external RSS feed. Because the fetch was requested by a user, these
fetchers generally ignore robots.txt rules. The general
[technical properties](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/overview-google-crawlers#crawl-technical-props)
of Google's crawlers also apply to the user-triggered fetchers.


The IP ranges the user-triggered fetchers use are
published in the
[user-triggered-fetchers.json](https://developers.google.com/static/crawling/ipranges/user-triggered-fetchers.json),
[user-triggered-fetchers-google.json](https://developers.google.com/static/crawling/ipranges/user-triggered-fetchers-google.json),
and [user-triggered-agents.json](https://developers.google.com/static/crawling/ipranges/user-triggered-agents.json)
objects. The user-triggered fetchers' reverse DNS mask, depending on whether the fetcher is Google
or user owned, matches `***-***-***-***.gae.googleusercontent.com` or
`google-proxy-***-***-***-***.google.com` respectively.


The following list shows the user-triggered fetchers, their user agent strings as they appear in
the HTTP requests, and the products they are associated with. The list is not exhaustive, it only
covers the requestors that are more likely to show up in log files and that we've received
questions about.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Caution** : The user agent string can be spoofed. [Learn how to verify if a request is from Google](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/verify-google-requests).
