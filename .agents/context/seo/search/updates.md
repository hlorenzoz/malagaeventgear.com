    specifications for the
    [product_type](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324406) and
    [google_product_category](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324436) attributes.

    schema.org properties to set the effective range for sale prices, including best practices and examples for placement on either `Offer` or `PriceSpecification` nodes.


    **Why** : This aligns schema.org usage with the Merchant Center feed attribute
    [sale_price_effective_date](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324460),

:

    ### Updating our AMP documentation

    **Why**: Starting today, Google Search is updating how it connects users to AMP pages,
    and will now take users directly to the publisher's AMP host pages. This change simplifies
    and reduces maintenance efforts for publishers who are creating AMP content, as they no
    longer need to update the AMP cache or configure signed exchanges. AMP content will
    continue to rank just like any other web page.

    **Why**: To address questions from the community and clarify that while these files
    aren't needed for Google Search (and won't negatively or positively impact your
    visibility or rankings), it's fine if you want to maintain these files for other services or
    systems that use them.

    **What** : Added the `hasAdultConsideration` property to the

    [Product variant](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-variants)
    documentation.


    **Why** : This property brings parity with the Merchant Center feed specification for the
    [adult property](https://support.google.com/merchants/answer/6324508).

May 15
:

    misconceptions, initial guidance on AI agents, and more information on why SEO best practices
    continue to be relevant for success in our generative AI features on Search.

    their content for appearance in generative AI features on Search, and what they can ignore.

    including generative AI responses.

    manual action.

:

    to address a deceptive practice known as "back button hijacking".


    **Why** : Learn more about this update in our [blog post on back button hijacking](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2026/04/back-button-hijacking).

## March 2026

    This prevents misinterpretations in our handling of forum and Q\&A content.

:

    ### Added a note on the robots meta tags documentation


    **What** : Added a note to the [robots meta tags documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag) on the way Google Search processes robots meta tags outside the HTML head.

March 4
:

    ### Removed outdated information about JavaScript and accessibility


    **What** : Removed a section on accessibility from [the JavaScript SEO basics documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics).


    **Why**: The information was out of date and not as helpful as it used to be. Google Search has been rendering JavaScript for multiple years now, so using JavaScript to load content is not "making it harder for Google Search".
    Most assistive technologies are able to work with JavaScript now as well.

March 2
:

    ### Added preferred image best practices


    **What** : Added a new section on [specifying a preferred image with metadata](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images#specify-preferred-image)
    to the image SEO best practices and [Discover documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover#images).


    **Why** : Based on feedback, we're clarifying that Google uses both schema.org markup and the `og:image`
    `meta` tag as sources when determining image thumbnails in Google Search and
    Discover.

February 3
:

    ### Clarified information about the default file size limits for Googlebot


    **What** : While moving over the information about the default file size limits of
    Google's crawlers and fetchers to the
    [crawler documentation](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/overview-google-crawlers#file-size-limits),
    we also updated the
    [Googlebot documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot)
    about its own file size limits.


    **Why**: The original location of the default file size limits was not the most logical
    place as it applies to all of Google's crawlers and fetchers, and the move enabled us to
    be more precise about Googlebot's limits.

## January 2026

January 30
:

    structured data type.


    **Why** : The practice problem structured data type is no longer shown in Google Search results.
    Learn more about this change in our [blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2025/06/simplifying-search-results) and [changelog entry](https://developers.google.com/search/updates#simplification-nov) announced in November 2025.

## 2025 updates

### December 2025

December 18
:

    ### Clarifying JavaScript execution on non-200 HTTP status codes


    **What** : We added a note on [how Googlebot processes JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics#how-googlebot-processes-javascript).


    **Why** : While pages with a `200` HTTP status code are sent to rendering, this might not be the case for pages with a non-`200` HTTP status code.

:

    ### Migrating more crawling documentation to a new location


    **What** : Migrated the following documentation to
    [Google's crawling infrastructure site](https://developers.google.com/crawling). The functionality hasn't changed,
    only the location of the documentation and some minor wording changes to clarify that some
    guidance applies to both Google Search and other Google products.

    - [Managing crawling of faceted navigation URLs](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/faceted-navigation)
    - [Optimize your crawl budget](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawl-budget)
    - [How HTTP status codes affect Google's crawlers](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/troubleshooting/http-status-codes)
    - [Debug DNS and network errors](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/troubleshooting/dns-network-errors)


    **Why**: This documentation is more relevant to many Google products that use Google's crawlers,
    not just Search.

December 17
:

    ### Clarifying canonicalization best practices for JavaScript


    **What** : We added a section on [canonicalization best practices for JavaScript](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics#canonicalization)
    to our [JavaScript documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics) and the [best practices for consolidation of duplicate URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidation-of-duplicate-urls#best-practices).


    **Why**: Canonicalization happens before and after rendering, so it's important to make the canonical URL as clear as possible. With JavaScript, this means setting the canonical URL to the same URL as in the original HTML or if that isn't possible, to leave the canonical URL out of the original HTML.

December 15
:

    ### Clarifying noindex and JavaScript


    **What** : Clarified in our [JavaScript documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics)
    how Google's crawler handles `noindex` tags in pages that use JavaScript.


    **Why** : While Google may be able to render a page that uses JavaScript, the behavior
    of this is not well defined and might change. If there's a possibility that you *do*
    want the page indexed, don't use a `noindex` tag in the original page code.

December 9
:

    ### Adding a section on smaller core updates


    **What** : Added information to the [core updates documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/core-updates#how-long)
    about how Google continually makes updates to our search algorithms (including smaller core updates),
    and how that can affect your website.


    **Why**: To clarify that site owners that make content improvements can see a rise in position in Google Search results without
    having to wait for the next major core update.

### November 2025

November 20
:

    ### Migrating Google's crawling documentation to a new location


    **What** : Migrated the following crawling documentation to a new location,
    [Google's crawling infrastructure documentation](https://developers.google.com/crawling)
    (the content hasn't changed, only the location). Notable moves include:

    - [Overview of Google crawlers and fetchers](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/overview-google-crawlers)
    - [Verify requests from Google crawlers and fetchers](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/verify-google-requests)
    - [Reduce the Google crawl rate](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/reduce-crawl-rate)
    - [Google common crawlers](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/crawlers-fetchers/google-common-crawlers)
    - [How Google interprets the robots.txt specification](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/robots-txt/robots-txt-spec)


    To subscribe to updates about Google's crawling infrastructure,
    add the [URL of the new changelog page](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/changelog) to your
    [feed reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_feed_aggregators),
    or add the feed URL directly:
    `https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/changelog/crawling_docs_updates.rss`.


    **Why**: Google's crawling infrastructure is shared across a variety of Google products beyond Search,
    including Google Shopping, News, Gemini, AdSense, and more. The new site
    is a more logical home for this documentation and makes it easier to document new features
    and updates that are relevant to all of these products.

November 19
:

    ### Removing guidance on the Follow feature in Discover


    **What** : Removed guidance on the [Follow feature](https://blog.chromium.org/2021/05/an-experiment-in-helping-users-and-web.html)
    from [Google Discover documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover).


    **Why**: The Follow feature is no longer shown in Google Discover.

November 12
:

    ### Clarifying nesting in reviews and aggregate ratings


    **What** : Clarified the [review snippet documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/review-snippet#technical-guidelines) to explain that site owners
    should avoid using multiple ways of indicating what's being reviewed.


    **Why**: To prevent ambiguity and make sure Google can better interpret your review and aggregate rating structured data.

:

    ### Adding a new user-triggered fetcher


    **What** : We added the
    [`Google-Pinpoint`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/google-user-triggered-fetchers#google-pinpoint)

    ### Removing and clarifying documentation for some structured data types


    **What** : Added a deprecation notice to the [practice problem](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/practice-problems)
    documentation. Starting in January 2026, we'll also be removing support for that feature
    in Search Console rich result reporting, the Rich Result Test, and the
    [list of Search appearance filters](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/7576553#by_search_appearance&zippy=%2Csearch-appearance).
    The [Search Console API](https://developers.google.com/webmaster-tools) will continue to support the
    practice problem type through January 2026.


    Clarified that [Dataset structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset)
    is only used by [Dataset Search](https://toolbox.google.com/datasetsearch/),
    and not Google Search. Removed the deprecation banner from
    [Book actions documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/book),
    as there's still a feature using the markup in Google Search.


    **Why** : As part of our [ongoing efforts to simplify the search results page](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2025/11/update-on-our-efforts),
    we are phasing out the practice problem and dataset structured data types from Google
    Search results.

    to the list of user-triggered fetchers.

### September 2025

    **Why** : To better help site owners reach their target audience while respecting user
    preferences around explicit content and minimizing access to violative explicit content. Also, the
    troubleshooting section has been separated for more clarity. Finally, Google Search is updating
    the ranking algorithms to more strongly affect the sites that host explicit videos but don't
    [allow Googlebot to fetch those video files](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/explicit/guidelines#allow-googlebot-to-crawl)
    (these sites may experience a significant drop in ranking, especially in Video mode).

    [Google's crawlers and user-triggered fetchers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers).
    This is just documentation change, no change in behavior.


    **Why** : We realized we never actually documented the content encodings Google's
    crawlers support, even though we
    [blogged about it in the past](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2008/03/first-date-with-googlebot-headers-and).

:

    ### Reorganizing the crawler documentation


    **What** : Reorganized the documentation for
    [Google's crawlers and user-triggered fetchers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers).
    We also added explicit notes about what product each crawler affects, and added a
    robots.txt snippet for each crawler to demonstrate how to use the user agent tokens.
    There were no meaningful changes to the content otherwise.


    **Why**: The documentation grew very long which limited our ability to extend the
    content about our crawlers and user-triggered fetchers.

    ### Clarifying Indexing API usage guidelines


    **What** : Clarified that [submissions to the Indexing API](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quickstart#get-started) are subject to spam detection.

    quotas may result in revoked access.

    ### Video markup accepts `ineligibleRegion`


    **What** : Added the [`ineligibleRegion` property](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#ineligible-region)
    to the video structured data documentation.


    **Why** : Google accepts the `ineligibleRegion` property as another way to
    [restrict a video](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#restrict-structured-data).

September 4
:

    ### Clarifying quota and usage of the Indexing API


    **What** : Clarified that the [default quota](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quota-pricing#quota)
    is for setting up the Indexing API, and how to
    [request approval and quota](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quota-pricing#request-more-quota).
    Also corrected a documentation error for [DefaultRequestsPerMinutePerProject quota](https://developers.google.com/search/apis/indexing-api/v3/quota-pricing#quota)
    (it's always been a 380 quota).


    **Why**: To better explain that the default quota is for initial setup and testing, and
    it requires additional approval for usage and resource provisioning.

    tags to automatically generate title links.

August 23
:

    ### Improving the Video SEO documentation


    **What** : Overhauled the [video SEO best practices](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video).
    Notably, we clarified the [video indexing criteria](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#indexing-criteria)
    and [technical requirements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#help-google-find),
    added a new [watch page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#watch-page) section, and
    expanded our examples.


    **Why**: Based on feedback submissions, we revisited our video SEO guidance to clarify
    what's eligible for a video result and how site owners can make it easier for Google to find
    their videos.

:

    ### Introducing the Google-CloudVertexBot crawler


    **What** : Added Google-CloudVertexBot to the [list of Google crawlers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#google-cloudvertexbot), a new crawler
    that crawls sites on the site owners' request when building
    [Vertex AI Agents](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/prepare-data#website).


    **Why**: The new crawler was introduced to help site owners identify the new crawler
    traffic.

August 15
:

    ### Improvements to the core updates documentation


    **What** : Restructured the [core updates documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates)
    so it has clearer sections and includes information from other docs (such as [traffic drops](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/debugging-search-traffic-drops)
    and the [self-assessment](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content) guidance).
    Reduced duplication with the [helpful content FAQ](https://developers.google.com/search/help/helpful-content-faq)
    and redirected that page. Moved the [helpful content system section](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide#helpful-content)
    to the archived section of the ranking systems guide.


    **Why** : To better help site owners assess a traffic drop and make improvements to their
    site. Also, the [helpful content system became part of core ranking systems](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-policies)
    (as we previously shared in March 2024).

    **What** : Clarified that [AI Overviews are counted and logged in Search Console](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-overviews#sc-logging)
    in the Performance report. This is a documentation clarification on methodology only, and
    not a change in Search Console reports.


    **Why**: To confirm the methodology behind how clicks, impressions, and position are
    recorded for AI Overviews, just as we do for featured snippets, carousels, and other types
    of Search results.

August 9
:

    ### Removing Notes documentation


    **What**: Removed the documentation about Notes.


    **Why** : The Notes experiment is no longer available. If you [created a note](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/13875847),
    your notes content is available to download using
    [Google Takeout](https://takeout.google.com/) through the
    end of August 2024.

    sexually explicit non-consensual, fake imagery in our
    [spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#legal-removals) and
    [ranking systems guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide#online-harassment-removals).

July 24
:

    ### Google Publisher Center user agent string update


    **What** : Changed the [Google Publisher Center user agent string](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#googleproducer)
    from `GoogleProducer; (+http://goo.gl/7y4SX)` to
    `GoogleProducer; (+https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#googleproducer)`.
    If you hardcoded the old value in your code, update the string to avoid potential bugs.


    **Why** :
    [goo.gl is going away](https://developers.googleblog.com/en/google-url-shortener-links-will-no-longer-be-available/).

July 19
:

    ### A note about Notes


    **What** : Added a note about the status of Notes to the
    [Notes](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/notes-and-your-website)
    documentation.

    **What** : Added Search Console shipping and return settings as an option and expanded on
    how precedence works in the
    [organization](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization#precedence)
    and [merchant listing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/merchant-listing#precedence)
    documentation.


    **Why** : [Search Console now supports shipping and return settings](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/07/configure-shipping-and-returns-search-console),
    and we want to make it clearer how overriding works when combining various configurations.

July 10
:

July 9
:

    ### Supporting a new IPTC digital source type


    **What** : Added [`compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia`](https://cv.iptc.org/newscodes/digitalsourcetype/compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia)
    to the [IPTC photo metadata documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/image-license-metadata#iptc-photo-metadata).


    **Why** : Google can now extract the `compositeWithTrainedAlgorithmicMedia` IPTC NewsCode.

July 5
:

    ### Clarifying fragment URL guidance


    **What** : Clarified our guidance about fragment URLs in the
    [URL structure documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/url-structure).


    **Why**: To make it easier to find the guideline about fragment URLs, as it was
    previously only mentioned in the JavaScript and mobile sites documentation.

### June 2024

June 21
:

    ### Clarifying return policy precedence


    **What** : Clarified in the [organization-level return policy documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization#merchant-return-policy-properties)
    that product-level return policy markup takes precedence over organization-level return policy markup.
    If you choose to use both markup (whether it's at the product- or organization-level, or both)
    and settings in Merchant Center, the Merchant Center return policy information
    takes precedence for any products submitted in your Merchant Center product feeds.


    **Why**: To address user feedback about which return policy method takes precedence.

June 20
:

    ### Marking up categories with many items for structured data carousels (beta)


    **What** : Added guidance on how to mark up categories with many items to the
    [structured data carousels (beta)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/carousels-beta#guidelines).


    **Why**: We received a question through our feedback button about how to implement this
    markup for categories with many items, such as paginated content or infinite scroll.

June 12
:

    ### Clarifying `link` tag attributes


    **What** : Clarified in our
    [`hreflang` documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions)
    that `link` tags for denoting alternate versions of a page must not be combined
    in a single `link` tag.


    **Why**: While debugging a report from a site owner we noticed we don't have this
    quirk documented.

June 11
:

    ### Adding support for `Organization`-level return policies


    **What** : Added documentation on how to specify a general
    [return policy for an `Organization`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/organization#merchant-return-policy-properties)
    as a whole.

    **Why**: This makes it easier to define and maintain general return policies for an entire site.

:

    ### Removing home activity documentation


    **What** : Removed documentation on [home activity structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/home-activities).

    **What** : Added a new case study about how
    [Vidio brought more locally relevant video-on-demand (VOD) content for Indonesian users through Google Search](https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/vidio-case-study).


    **Why**: To show how adding video structured data and following best practices
    can improve video discoverability.

:

    ### Updating Discussion Forum guidelines


    **What** : Confirm that [`SocialMediaPosting` markup is also supported](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/discussion-forum#content-guidelines) and allow
    [only image or video in comments without text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/discussion-forum#comment-content).

    **Why**: To more accurately reflect how the data ingestion
    for these features work and to remove noise in validation reports.

:

    ### Resolving the issue with site names and internal pages


    **What** : Removed the warning about the issue that was preventing new
    [site names](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/site-names)
    from propagating to internal pages.

    **Why**: The issue has been resolved. Keep in mind that it takes time for
    Google to recrawl and process the new information, including recrawling your internal pages.

### May 2024

May 23
:

    ### Adding `epub` to indexable file types


    **What** : Added EPUB to [the list of indexable file types](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types).

    **What** : Added two new crawlers,
    [GoogleOther-Image](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#googleother-image)
    and
    [GoogleOther-Video](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#googleother-video),
    which are versions of GoogleOther optimized for fetching image and video bytes
    respectively. While at it, we also updated the list of user agent strings of GoogleOther
    to better reflect the most active user agent versions.

    **Why**: The new crawlers were launched to better support crawling of binary data that
    may be used for research and development.

May 14
:

    ### Introduced AI Overviews in the documentation


    **What** : Added a separate page for
    [AI
    Overviews and your website](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ai-overviews),
    and updated the existing pages for
    [robots meta tags](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag) and
    [subscription and
    paywalled content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/paywalled-content) accordingly.

    **Why**: AI Overviews in Search are replacing Search Generative Experience.

May 1
:

    ### Restructuring the `Product` structured data documentation


    **What** : Reorganized the `Product` structured data documentation into three pages:
    [intro to product markup](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product),
    [product snippet](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-snippet), and
    [merchant listing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/merchant-listing).
    Added a new section about
    [deciding which markup to use](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#decide).

    **Why**: The previous tabbed structure was difficult to navigate and find the property you
    were looking for.

### April 2024

April 26
:

    ### Improvements to the debugging traffic drops documentation


    **What** : Expanded on the effects of [algorithmic updates](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/debugging-search-traffic-drops#algo)
    and how to identify them. Simplified the section on policy and manual actions to be about
    spam issues.

    **Why**: To better help site owners identify reasons for a traffic drop.

April 25
:

    ### Exporting an additional range of Google fetcher IP addresses


    **What** :
    [Added an additional list of IP addresses](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/verifying-googlebot)
    for fetchers that are controlled by Google products, as opposed to, for example, a user controlled
    [Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).
    The new list,
    [`user-triggered-fetchers-google.json`](https://developers.google.com/static/search/apis/ipranges/user-triggered-fetchers-google.json),
    contains IP ranges that have been in use for a long time.

    **Why**: It became technically possible to export the ranges.

:

    ### Removing the iOS variant of AdsBot Mobile Web


    **What** : Removing the iOS variant of AdsBot Mobile Web from the

April 24
:

    ### Adding definitions for favicon `rel` attribute values


    **What** : Added definitions for each supported `rel` attribute value in the
    [favicon documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/favicon-in-search#implementation).

    **Why**: We got a question about which value to use for a favicon and if there's a difference.

April 17
:

    ### Removing video carousel (limited access) documentation


    **What** : Removed video carousel guidance from the
    [video structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video).

    **Why**: We initially tested video carousel markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately
    found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. You can leave the markup on your
    site so that search engines and other systems can better understand your web page.

April 16
:

    ### Clarifying image extraction source


    **What** : [Clarified](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images) that images are
    only extracted from the `src` attribute of `img` tags.

    **Why**: While not a new change, we occasionally get questions about what HTML
    elements Google Search can extract images from.

April 11
:

    ### Clarifying the beta carousels feature


    **What** : Clarified that the [beta carousel feature](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/carousels-beta)
    is for sites that have a summary page that links out to other detail pages on their website.
    The markup must be on the summary page, and you don't need to add markup to the detail
    pages in order to be eligible for this feature.

    **Why**: Based on feedback and questions you submitted, we added more precise guidance on what
    use cases are supported and what page you need to add markup. This is a documentation
    update only; there's no material change in feature requirements or eligibility.

### March 2024

March 28
:

    ### Clarified our changelog entry regarding availability of Web Stories


    **What** : Clarified our [February 8 changelog entry](https://developers.google.com/search/updates#web-stories-availability)
    regarding the feature availability of Web Stories in Google Images.


    **Why** : Web Stories continue to appear in Google Images, just as other web content may
    appear, but Web Stories no longer appear with the Web Stories icon in Google Images. Also,
    a bug that was blocking Search Console reporting for these URLs in Google Images
    [is now resolved](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/6211453#zippy=%2Cperformance-reports-search-results-discover-google-news).

March 25
:

    ### Added 3D models for products


    **What** : We added new `3DModel` markup support for merchant listings in the [product structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/merchant-listing#3d-model-example).


    **Why**: Sometimes 3D models appear on pages with multiple products and are not clearly connected with any of them. This markup lets site owners link a 3D model to a specific product.

March 12
:

    ### Clarified references to page experience and Core Web Vitals


    **What** : Clarified how we talk about page experience and Core Web Vitals in our documentation on
    [page experience](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience),
    [signed exchanges](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange)
    and [ecommerce pagination](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce/pagination-and-incremental-page-loading).
    Additionally updated to reflect that [INP](https://web.dev/articles/inp) is now a Core Web Vital.


    **Why** : [INP replaces FID as a Core Web Vital](https://web.dev/blog/inp-cwv-launch).

March 6
:

    ### Cleaning up recipe documentation


    **What** : Removed guided recipes from the
    [recipe structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/carousels-beta).


    **Why** : As this [Google Assistant feature was removed](https://blog.google/products/assistant/google-assistant-update-january-2024/),
    we're updating our recipe markup documentation to reflect that change. There's no change needed
    from site owners; all properties continue to be recommended for use in Google Search.

March 5
:

    ### New spam policies


    We added 3 new spam policies:
    [expired domain abuse](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#expired-domains),
    [scaled content abuse](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#scaled-content),
    and
    [site reputation abuse](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#site-reputation).
    Also added a new [FAQ on helpful content](https://developers.google.com/search/help/helpful-content-faq).
    Check out [our blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/03/core-update-spam-policies) for
    more details on what changed and why.

:

    ### Generic Chrome version for Google StoreBot


    **What** : Updated the Google StoreBot user agent (in [Overview of Google crawlers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers))
    to use a placeholder version of Chrome. If you hardcoded the old value in your code,
    update it to ignore the version.


    **Why**: To make it easier for the Google Shopping team to maintain the StoreBot crawler.

### February 2024

February 29
:

    ### Adding new carousel documentation (beta)


    **What** : Added documentation for [structured data carousels (beta)](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/carousels-beta).


    **Why**: To make it easier for site owners to add carousel markup for new query types,
    such as for travel, local, and shopping queries.

:

    ### Added opt out information for place entities in Page Insights


    **What** : Added information about how site owners can [opt out of display in the Place Entity feature](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/control-what-you-share#page-insights)
    in Page Insights.


    **Why**: To make it easier for site owners to control how their content appears on Google.


February 20
:

    ### Added support for product variants


    **What** : Added new [product variant structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product-variants).
    Also added a new `isVariantOf` property to the
    [product structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product)
    and clarified that Google [support product variants with distinct URLs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce/designing-a-url-structure-for-ecommerce-sites#how-google-understands-urls-for-product-variants).


    **Why**: To better support product variant scenarios for ecommerce sites. Since product
    variants can be a complex and important concept for ecommerce websites (especially for categories like
    apparel and electronics), we're providing more examples and guidance on how to add product
    variant structured data.

:

    ### Clarified return fees markup for products


    **What** : Clarified when to use `FreeReturn` versus
    `ReturnShippingFees` as value for
    `https://schema.org/returnfees`
    for product returns in the [product structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product).


    **Why**: To better support more granular shipping and return fee scenarios.

February 15
:

    ### Clarifying the extraction of `rel="canonical"` annotations


    **What** : Clarified that
    [`rel="canonical"` annotations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls#use-rel=canonical-link-annotations)
    with certain attributes are not used for canonicalization.


    **Why** : The `rel="canonical"` annotations help Google determine which URL
    of a set of duplicates is the canonical. Adding certain attributes to the
    `link` element changes the meaning of the annotation to denote a different
    device or language version. This is a documentation change only; Google has always ignored
    these `rel="canonical"` annotations for canonicalization purposes.

February 9
:

    ### Clarifying the use of spaces in product SKUs


    **What** : Clarified what characters are allowed in product SKUs in
    the [Product structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#merchant-listings_product).


    **Why** : To better explain why a `sku` value might be invalid in the Rich
    Results Test.

    ### Image removals documentation refresh


    **What** : Part of our ongoing efforts to keep our documentation accurate, we updated
    the documentation for [image removals](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/prevent-images-on-your-page)
    with more precise language, and addressed some documentation feedback.


    **Why**: We review and, if necessary, refresh our documentation periodically. This
    update is part of that process.


February 8
:

    ### Updated the availability of Web Stories


    **What** : Updated the [feature availability](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/enable-web-stories#feature-availability)
    of Web Stories.


    **Why**: To make sure our documentation aligns with how the feature appears in Google Search.
    Web Stories don't appear in Google Images with an icon anymore, and the grid view is now a carousel view in
    Search results.

    ### Updated the description of the Google-Extended product token


    **What** : With the name change of Bard to Gemini Apps, we clarified that Gemini Apps is
    affected by [Google-Extended](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/google-common-crawlers#google-extended),
    and, based on publisher feedback, we specified that Google-Extended doesn't affect Google
    Search.

    ### Updated Dynamic Search Ad targets crawl frequency


    **What** : Updated the crawl frequency for Dynamic Search Ad targets in the [managing crawl budget guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/large-site-managing-crawl-budget).


    **Why**: To reduce stress on sites, Dynamic Search Ads crawls now occur less frequently, 21 days instead of 14 days.


February 6
:

    ### Revisited JavaScript documentation


    **What** : Reviewed our guidance on [JavaScript SEO basics](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics), [fixing Search-related JavaScript problems](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/fix-search-javascript), [lazy-loading content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/lazy-loading) to remove outdated or unnecessary information. We updated our documentation on [dynamic rendering](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/dynamic-rendering) to clarify it's a deprecated workaround.

    **Why**: Feedback from you showed us there are opportunities to improve and clarify a few aspects. A few things, like dynamic rendering, have evolved in the past few years and our documentation now reflects these developments.


February 5
:

    ### A new case study


    **What** : Added a new case study about how
    [How Wix generated value for their users by integrating Google APIs](https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/wix-case-study).


    **Why**: To explain how a CMS platform can integrate Google APIs directly into their UI,
    and what impact it had for their users.

:

    ### Revamping the SEO Starter Guide


    The [SEO Starter Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide) got a
    refresh: we removed outdated content, streamlined and simplified other parts, and added a few
    sections. Check out our [blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2024/02/ssg-gets-a-makeover)
    for more in-depth explanation on what we changed and why.

### January 2024


January 25
:

    ### Refreshing the Googlebot documentation


    **What** : Part of our ongoing efforts to keep our documentation accurate, we updated
    the documentation for [Googlebot](http://googlebot.com/)
    with more precise language. There was no actionable change to the documentation otherwise.


    **Why**: We review and, if necessary, refresh our documentation periodically. This
    update is part of that process.


January 10
:

    ### More accessible anchor texts


    **What**: Part of our ongoing efforts to make our documentation more accessible, we
    updated various anchor texts so they're more descriptive of the target page.


    **Why** : Depending on the settings of a screen reader, the user may be jumping from
    link to link on a page, thus each
    [anchor text on a page should be descriptive](https://www.mtu.edu/accessibility/training/web/link-text/),
    even without the surrounding context.


January 9
:

    ### Switching `@id` references to use hashtags


    **What** : Switch all structured data code examples that use in-page
    `@id` references to use hashtags instead. For example, the
    [clips example in our recipe documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe#video-with-clips).


    **Why**: It's a schema best practice to use hashtags as resolvable in-page node identifiers in RDF, and
    we want our examples follow best practices. However, you don't need to change your
    existing IDs if you're still using in-page identifiers.

    ### Adding support for `suggestedAge` to `Product`


    **What** : Added support for the `suggestedAge` property as an alternative
    to `suggestedMaxAge` and `suggestedMinAge`. Clarified the
    list of possible values for age ranges in our
    [Product structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product).


    **Why**: We want to make it easier and more flexible for people to specify age ranges
    for a product. Also, the previous wording was
    confusing and didn't map well to the Merchant Center documentation about product age ranges.


January 5
:

    ### Clarifying primary source of snippets


    **What** : Clarified in our
    [documentation about snippets](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet) that the
    primary source of the snippet is the page content itself.


    **Why**: The previous wording incorrectly implied that structured data and the meta
    description HTML element are the primary sources for snippets.

## 2023 updates

### December 2023

- **December 19** : Further clarified how Google handles sites with a high proportion of non-consensual explicit imagery in our [spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies) and [ranking systems guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide).

### November 2023

- **November 14** : Since we received many questions about the Google Safety crawler over the past year, added it to the [list of Google crawlers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#special-case-crawlers).

- **October 18** :

Also added a [Generative AI in Search considerations](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/paywalled-content#gen-ai) section. Added information about SGE (Search Generative Experience) to the [Robots meta tag, `data-nosnippet`, and X-Robots-Tag specifications page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag) for the [`nosnippet`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag#nosnippet) and [`max-snippet`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots-meta-tag#max-snippet) rules.
  - Clarified in the [favicon documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/favicon-in-search) that both the favicon file and the home page of the site must be allowed for crawling by Googlebot-Image and Googlebot respectively. Also removed information about the Google Favicon HTTP `user-agent` string throughout our documentation, as this is no longer used. The removal of the HTTP `user-agent` string means no changes for site owners. Google Favicon depended on the `Googlebot-Image` and `Googlebot` robots.txt user agent tokens, which remain supported.
- **October 17** :
  - Added a reminder to provide the timezone in [Article structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article) and clarified what happens if a timezone isn't provided.

- **September 29** : Added more explanation about [why Discover traffic may change over time](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover#traffic-changes).
- **September 28** : Added a new user agent token, [`Google-Extended`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/google-common-crawlers#google-extended), which acts as a new control that web publishers can use to manage whether their sites help improve Bard and Vertex AI generative APIs, including future generations of models that power those products.
- **September 27** : Clarified how Google handles sites with a high proportion of CSAM content in our [spam policies](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#legal-removals) and [ranking systems guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide#removals).
- **September 26** :
  - Revamped two previously published blog posts into new documentation pages with tips to [debug drops in search traffic](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/debugging-search-traffic-drops) and [improve SEO with a Search Console bubble chart](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/bubble-chart-analysis).

- **September 14** :
  - Added new guidance about [hosting third-party content](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/helpful-content-update#hosting-third-party-content) and more explanation on [what to do after a helpful content system update](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/helpful-content-update#what-to-do) (perhaps you don't need to do anything, or perhaps self-assess your content).
  - Added new points about [removing content or changing dates](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content#changing-dates) to the help page on how to create helpful, reliable people-first content.
  - Removed the [How-to rich result case study](https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/stylecraze-case-study), as [this feature is deprecated](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/08/howto-faq-changes).
  - Removed the [How-to structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/how-to), as this rich result is no longer shown in search results, on both desktop and mobile devices. [Read more in the blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/08/howto-faq-changes).
  - Updated the [FAQ structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage) to state that the feature is only shown for well-known, authoritative government and health websites.

- **September 6** : Added transcript of [September 2023 Google SEO Office Hours](https://developers.google.com/search/help/office-hours/2023/september).

- **August 15** : Clarified that we only support standard schema.org enumeration values for [local business opening hours](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business#dayofweek), and these values must be in English per the schema.org specification.

This is not new information; see the [guidelines about self-serving reviews](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data/review-snippet#self-serving) and [the update on our blog post from 2019](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/09/making-review-rich-results-more-helpful#updated).

- **April 26** : Increased the maximum number of return countries (`applicableCountry`) from 25 to 50 in the [return policy information](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#merchant-listings_merchant-return-policy) in the Product structured data documentation.

- **February 3** : Clarified why [JSON-LD is recommended for structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data#supported-formats): it's because it's generally the easiest for website owners to implement and maintain. All 3 supported formats are equally fine for Google, as long as they are valid and implemented properly per the feature's documentation.
- **February 2** : Refreshed our documentation about canonicalization. To better help site owners, the original documentation is split in three distinct sections:
  1. [What is URL canonicalization](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/canonicalization).
  2. [How to specify a canonical with `rel="canonical"` and other methods](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/consolidate-duplicate-urls).

  - Added guidance about what to include in the [RSS feed for the Follow feature in Google Discover](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-discover#feed-guidelines): the `<title>` element and your per item `<link>` elements.
  - Updated the [Images best practices](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images) to clarify that [Google parses `<img>` elements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images#semantic-html) (even when they're enclosed in other elements such as `<picture>` elements) when indexing images. Also updated the alt text and filenames in the examples to be more descriptive.
- **January 6** : Clarified that `www` and `m` prefixes for domain names are generally considered as root domain names for [Site Names in Google Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/site-names).
- **January 5** : Added information about the `If-Modified-Since` request header to our [documentation about managing crawl budget](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/troubleshoot-crawling-errors#if-modified-since).
- **January 3** : Removed the 110 character limit for the `headline` property in the [Article structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article#article-types). There's no hard character limit; instead, we recommend that you write concise titles as long titles may be truncated on some devices.

## 2022 updates

### December 2022

- **December 29** : Added transcript of [December 2022 Google SEO Office Hours](https://developers.google.com/search/help/office-hours/2022/december).

We introduced Web Light to enable us to serve faster, lighter pages to people searching on entry-level devices. While this feature has worked as intended and enabled broader access to the richness of the web, increased affordability of more powerful smartphones has diminished the need for such functionality. We remain committed to evolving and refining the Search experience to meet the changing needs of our users.
- **December 14** :
  - Added link spam specific information to the [spam updates](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/spam-updates) documentation.

  - Cleaned up and consolidated our [mobile site and mobile-first indexing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/mobile) related documentation. Unsurprisingly, there's no additions.
- **December 6** : Updated the [Helpful content system page](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/helpful-content-update) to state that the classifier works globally across all languages.
- **December 2** : Added two new myths to the [crawl budget documentation](https://developers.google.com/crawling/docs/myths-about-crawling). `noindex` isn't a good way to control crawl budget (but can be a method to indirectly free up crawl budget in the long run), and pages that serve `4xx` status codes (except `429`) don't waste crawl budget.
- **December 1** : Retired the [Duplex on the web user agent](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#retired).

### November 2022

- **November 23** : Added descriptions to enumerated properties, such as availability, in [Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product) to support page translation to non-English languages.
- **November 22** :
  - Added a list of currently supported languages for [video key moments](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#key-moments).
  - Clarified the eligibility criteria for rich result appearance in the [General structured data guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sd-policies).
- **November 21** :
  - Added a new section on [Policy circumvention](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#policy-circumvention) and clarified our phrasing in the [Legal](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#copyright-removal-requests) and [personal information removals](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#online-harassment-removals) sections to align with definitions of those systems in the new [Guide to Google Search ranking systems](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide).
  - Added a new [Guide to Google Search ranking systems](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ranking-systems-guide).
- **November 15** : Removed the [Mobile recharge Early Adoptors Program signup page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/mobile-recharge), as we received enough signups.
- **November 14** : Updated [Review Snippet structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/review-snippet) to recommend using dot separators for decimal ratings. If you're currently using comma separators for decimal ratings in your markup, you'll still be eligible for review snippets. However, we recommend that you update your markup for a more accurate interpretation.
- **November 9** : Clarified that it's fine to use JavaScript to insert [crawlable links](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/links-crawlable) into pages.
- **November 8** :
  - Clarified in the [sitemap documentation for localized versions](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions#sitemap) that child elements don't count towards the total number of URLs in a sitemap file.
  - Added notes to the [AdsBot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers) user agents that they ignore the global (`*`) `user-agent` rules in robots.txt. This was documented already in our [robots.txt documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/create-robots-txt); we added the notes for consistency.

### October 2022

- **October 24** : Clarified that [site names are supported](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/site-names#technical-guidelines) at the domain level, and not at the subdomain or subdirectory level. [Favicons are supported](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/favicon-in-search#guidelines) at the domain and subdomain level, and not at the subdirectory level.
- **October 14** : Added the [site name documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/site-names).
- **October 13** :
  - Added new pages for the following Google ranking updates. The information itself isn't new; the pages contain consolidated information from previous blog posts about each of these updates.
    - [Google Search's core updates and your website](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/core-updates)
    - [Google Search's helpful content update and your website](https://developers.google.com/search/updates/helpful-content-update)

      - [Malware and malicious behaviors](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#malware-and-malicious-behaviors): Consolidates information that was previously in the Security section on our site.
      - [Hacked content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#hacked-content): Consolidates information that was previously in the Security section on our site.
      - [Thin affliliate pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/essentials/spam-policies#thin-affiliate-pages): Consolidates previous pages on Thin content and Affiliate programs.

    - [Creating helpful, reliable, people-first content](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/creating-helpful-content): This document consolidates advice from the [helpful content blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/08/helpful-content-update) and the [core updates post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2019/08/core-updates); none of the content is new.
- **October 12** : Added support for image credits to the [Image Metadata structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/image-license-metadata) documentation. Previously, you could only provide image credit information with IPTC photo metadata.

### September 2022

- **September 20** : Added the [Google Site Verifier](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers#google_site_verifier) user agent.
- **September 13** :
  - Major update to [Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product) documentation to document requirements for eligibility to Merchant Listings experiences based on structured data. See the blog [New Search Console Merchant Listings report: expanding eligibility with Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/09/merchant-listings) for details.
  - Re-added the `itemReviewed.datePublished` property. This was removed accidentally as part of the previous update to the [Fact Check structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/factcheck#structured-data-type-definitions).
- **September 9** : Removed the `datePublished` property from the [Fact Check structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/factcheck#structured-data-type-definitions). Currently, the `ClaimReview` publish date isn't used in the Fact Check rich result.
- **September 2** : Migrated the documentation about the [file types Google can index](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/indexable-file-types) from the Search Console Help Center (the content hasn't changed).
- **September 1** : Added more examples to show [how meta descriptions could be improved](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#use-quality-descriptions).

### August 2022

- **August 31** : Added a note on the use of JavaScript to add, change, or remove `meta` tags on a page to [the list of meta and inline tags Google Search understands](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/crawling/special-tags).
- **August 29** :
  - Added the [full list of supported academic values for `educationalLevel`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/learning-video#educational-level) in the Learning video structured data documentation.
  - Clarified how to specify multiple types in [Local Business structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business#local-business-properties). If you have multiple types, specify them in an array (`additionalType` isn't supported).
- **August 24** :
  - Added [content guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/education-qa#content-guidelines) to the Education Q\&A structured data documentation.
  - Removed references to the [deprecated International Targeting report](https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/12474899) in Search Console. The recommendations described in our documentation about [managing multiregional sites](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/managing-multi-regional-sites) and [localized versions of your pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/international/localized-versions) remain relevant.
- **August 22** : Updated the [Article structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article) to reflect that `Article` markup is open to all types of pages (as [announced in 2020 with the page experience update](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating-page-experience#page-experience-and-the-mobile-top-stories-feature)).
- **August 11**: Removed our documentation about rich-media files, such as Silverlight and Flash. Turns out it's not 2005 anymore.
- **August 10** :
  - Added the `gtin12` property to the [Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product) documentation. This has been supported; it's a documentation change only. Clarified that you can use the generic `gtin` property for all GTINs, but we recommend that you use the most specific one if possible.
  - Updated the [dynamic rendering](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/dynamic-rendering) documentation to explain that this isn't a recommended solution, and is a workaround if you have no other choice. Instead we recommend server-side rendering, static rendering, or client-side rendering with hydration.
- **August 9** : Added best practices for feeds to the [Follow feature documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/mobile/google-discover#follow). We recommend that you:
  - Use a descriptive title for your RSS feed, just like you would for a web page.
  - For multiple feeds, we recommend that you use a single feed. Both methods are still supported, but we clarified that a single feed is easier for you to maintain and for users to subscribe to your feed.
- **August 8** : Clarified that we don't support the URL form for GTINs in [Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product). Make sure to use the numerical GTIN form.
- **August 5** : Added documentation about the [pros and cons](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#pros-cons) enhancement for editorial product review pages.

### July 2022

- **July 19** : Standardized how we refer to [headings and title text](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link) on the page. Previously we used the word headline, but that can be confusing in other languages.
- **July 13** : Updated the User Agent string for [AdsBot Mobile Web](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers). If you hardcoded the old value in your code, update the string to avoid potential bugs.
- **July 7** : Added a new page for [Google Search ranking updates](https://status.search.google.com/products/rGHU1u87FJnkP6W2GwMi/history). This is not new information; it's a compiled list of things we've previously confirmed on [our blog](https://developers.google.com/search/blog) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/googlesearchc).
- **July 6** : Reorganized the navigational structure to be based on topic instead of level. Removed duplicate guides that were aimed at basic or beginner level, as these documents were duplicating guidance already explained in the [SEO Starter Guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/seo-starter-guide).
- **July 4** : Clarified that you must add three courses to be eligible for the [`Course`
  rich result](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/course). This is not a new requirement; it was previously only documented in the [Carousel documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/carousel).

### June 2022

- **June 30** : Added information about using JavaScript to [inject canonical link tags](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/javascript/javascript-seo-basics#properly-inject-canonical-links).
- **June 23** : Added information about how many bytes of textual content, such as HTML, [Googlebot](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/googlebot) will crawl. For [FAQs on the matter, check out our blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/06/googlebot-15mb).
- **June 22** : Updated the [Job Posting](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-posting) documentation to specify that when you use the `jobLocation` property, you must also include the `addressCountry` property.
- **June 17** : Clarified that [product rich results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#guidelines) support pages that focus on a single product, and that includes product variants where each product variant has a distinct URL.
- **June 10** : Documented new `Vary: Cookie` support for [signed exchanges](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange).
- **June 3** : Added a best practice for [script or language mismatches in titles](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link#mismatch-of-script-or-language-used-in-title-elements). For `<title>` elements, use the same script and language as the page's primary content.
- **June 1** :
  - Added new [author markup best practices](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article#author-bp) to the Article structured data documentation.
  - Added new documentation about [Learning Video structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/learning-video).

### May 2022

- **May 31** : Removed the [Job training structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-training). We initially tested this markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. This change doesn't affect any other features that may use Job training markup. You can leave the markup on your site so that search engines can better understand your web page.
- **May 22** : Added [transparency guidelines for video thumbnails](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#provide-a-high-quality-thumbnail). Ensure that at least 80% of your thumbnail pixels have little or no transparency to enable video indexing.

<!-- -->

- **May 10** :
  - Added new [Education Q\&A](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/education-qa) documentation.
  - Added new documentation about [using valid page metadata](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/valid-html).
  - Added new [troubleshooting tip about headlines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link#no-clear-main-headline) in the title link documentation.
- **May 6** : Removed the deprecated tags and attributes from the [Image](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/image-sitemaps#deprecated-tags-and-attributes) and [Video](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/video-sitemaps#deprecated-tags-and-attributes) sitemaps documentation. For more information, refer to our [announcement about the deprecation](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/05/spring-cleaning-sitemap-extensions).

### April 2022

- **April 14** : Consolidated our [How Search Works documentation for site owners](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/fundamentals/how-search-works) by merging the basic, beginner, and advanced versions into one central document. While we cleaned up the language slightly, we haven't added anything new to the How Search Works documentation.

### March 2022

- **March 23** : Added two more best practices when [writing high quality product reviews](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce/write-high-quality-reviews) for reviews comparing multiple products.
- **March 17** : Added a section to the SafeSearch documentation about [allowing Google to fetch your video content files](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/safesearch#allow-fetch).

### February 2022

- **February 25** : Removed a reference to the Crawl Stats report in the [signed
  exchange documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange). This is no longer relevant as of the update from November 4.
- **February 11** : Added link to [SXG
  Validator Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sxg-validator/hiijcdgcphjeljafieaejfhodfbpmgoe) in the [signed
  exchange documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange).

### January 2022

- **January 28** : Merged our SafeSearch documentation into [one new document](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/safesearch). We expanded on how SafeSearch works and added a troubleshooting section. The guidance remains the same: [add the `rating` `meta` tag to explicit pages](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/safesearch#add-metadata) and [group explicit content in a separate location on your site](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/safesearch#group-content).
- **January 21** : Added a new robots `meta` tag, [`indexifembedded`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots_meta_tag#indexifembedded), to the robots `meta` tag documentation. [Learn more about the new tag in our blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2022/01/robots-meta-tag-indexifembedded).
- **January 20** : Added a note describing how to specify [`Car`](https://schema.org/Car) markup and still have [Product review snippet](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product) feature eligibility.
- **January 18** : Removed guidance about specifying a range for the `cookTime`, `prepTime`, and `totalTime` properties in the [Recipe documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/recipe). Currently, the only supported method is an exact time; time ranges aren't supported. If you're currently specifying a time range and you'd like Google to better understand your time values, we recommend updating that value in your structured data to a single value (for example, `"cookTime": "PT30M"`).

## 2021 updates

### December 2021

- **December 16** : Converted our old [blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2016/08/helping-users-easily-access-content-on) about intrusive interstitials into [guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/avoid-intrusive-interstitials). There are no substantial changes compared to what we have in the blog post.

- **November 17** :
  - Added an [interactive checklist](https://developers.google.com/search) that suggests readings based on the profile users select.
  - Added documentation about [translated
    results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/translated-results) and how to [enable
    your ad network to work with translation-related Google Search features](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/ad-network-and-translation).

  - [Published the list of Googlebot IP addresses](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/verifying-googlebot).
- **November 4** : Removed the recommendation to verify that SXGs are well-formed from the [signed exchange documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange). Added a note that Google will automatically retry without an SXG `Accept` header in these cases.
- **November 4** : Updated the [page experience documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience) to include the [upcoming desktop rollout](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/11/bringing-page-experience-to-desktop).
- **November 2** : Added a recommendation about creating a dedicated page for each video to the [Video best practices](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#help-google-find).

### October 2021

- **October 28** : Removed the following structured data fields from documentation, since they are unused by Google Search and Rich Result Test doesn't flag warnings for them:
  - `HowTo`: `description`.
  - `QAPage`: `mainEntity.suggestedAnswer.author`, `mainEntity.dateCreated`, `mainEntity.suggestedAnswer.dateCreated`, `mainEntity.acceptedAnswer.author`, `mainEntity.acceptedAnswer.dateCreated`, and `mainEntity.author
    `.
  - `SpecialAnnouncement`: `provider`, `audience`, `serviceType`, `address`, and `category`.
- **October 15** : Added a requirement that the `author.name` field in [Review snippets](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/review-snippet) must be less than 100 characters to be eligible for use in Search features.
- **October 13** : Clarified that `VideoGame` is not a valid node type for [Software Apps](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/software-app#extended-properties-for-app-subtypes). To make sure that your Software App is still eligible for a rich result appearance, co-type the `VideoGame` type with another supported type.
- **October 8** : Updated our documentation about titles and snippets in Google Search results. There are now two separate documents that explain each of these search result features:
  - **[Control your title
    links in search results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link)** : Created a new page to describe how to control title links in search results. Introduced a new term, *title link* , for the title of a search result on Google Search and other properties to help clarify when we mean the title link in search results versus a `<title>` element on a web page. Added examples of [how
    Google may adjust title links](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link#examples). There aren't any changes to the [best practices
    for writing descriptive `<title>` elements](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/title-link#page-titles).
  - **[Control your
    snippets in search results](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet)** : Created a new page to describe how to control snippets in search results. The updates were minimal structural updates; there aren't any changes to the [guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/snippet#meta-descriptions) themselves.

### September 2021

- **September 27** : Added new documentation on [Best practices for ecommerce sites in Google Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/specialty/ecommerce).
- **September 1** : Added documentation about the [beta
  Follow feature and your website](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/mobile/google-discover#follow).

### August 2021

- **August 11** : Added a new case study about how [large
  images in Discover improve CTR and increase visits to publisher sites](https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/large-images-case-study).
- **August 9** : The [Schema
  Markup Validator](https://validator.schema.org/) has stabilized, and Google now redirects the Structured Data Testing Tool to a [landing page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/structured-data) to help you select the right tool.
- **August 6** : Added a new recommended `author.url` property to the [`Article` structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article). The `url` property helps Google disambiguate the correct author of the article.

### July 2021

- **July 30** : Added technical, content, and quality guidelines to the [Math solver guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/math-solvers#guidelines) and removed solution page markup instructions to make it easier for site owners to get their math solver site on Search. It is fine to remove any existing solution page markup.
- **July 29** : Added a new case study about how [MX Player boosted organic traffic 3x by maximizing video discoverability on Google](https://developers.google.com/search/case-studies/mx-case-study).
- **July 28** :
  - Removed [guidance](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/factcheck#technical-guidelines) about hosting multiple factchecks per page. To be eligible for the single fact check rich result, a page must only have one `ClaimReview` element.
  - Added details about [signed exchange](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange) cache lifetime.
- **July 26** : Added a requirement that `priceRange` fields in [Local
  business](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business) must be less than 100 characters to be eligible for use in Search features.
- **July 22** :
  - Added example use cases for the [FAQ
    guideline](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/faqpage#content-guidelines) about hidden content on the page. The user must be able to access the answer on the page, and clicking an expandable section to view the answer is a valid use case.
  - Removed the `@id` property from the [Local
    business documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/local-business). The `url` property alone is a sufficient identifier to understand the local business.
- **July 21** : Added a set of new documentation about the [search operators](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/monitor-debug/search-operators) available in Google Search.
- **July 13** : Added a new [editorial
  guideline](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-posting#editorial) to the `JobPosting` documentation. Added a new optional property for [`directApply`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-posting#direct-apply).

### June 2021

- **June 29** : Significantly expanded our [redirects guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/301-redirects) with the different kinds of redirects and their effects on Google Search.
- **June 25** : Added a page that details [how different HTTP status codes, and network and DNS errors affect crawling and indexing](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/http-network-errors).
- **June 18** : Based on feedback we've received from Search Central Product Experts and through the feedback tool, we've made several updates to our documentation:
  - Simplified the [introduction page](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/intro) to make it clearer what is robots.txt and what is its intended use.
  - Expanded the instructions about [creating](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/create-robots-txt) and [updating](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/submit-updated-robots-txt) robots.txt files.
  - Removed redundant sections from our documentation about [how Google handles robots.txt](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/robots/robots_txt).
  - Simplified sentences across all robots.txt documentation in English. This helps with localization.
  - Removed redundant documentation about how to build, test, and release structured data. Each feature has guidance about this, embedded directly into each guide (for example, the [Video structured data guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#add-structured-data)).
  - Improved the troubleshooting sections across all structured data feature guides (for example, the [Product structured data guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#troubleshooting)).
  - Added more beginner-friendly information about how to [get
    started with structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data#get-started).
- **June 15** : Updated the timeline in the [page
  experience documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/page-experience). The page experience update is now slowly rolling out to all users. It will be complete by the end of August 2021.
- **June 11** :
  - Clarified the [Sitelinks search box](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/sitelinks-searchbox#potential-action-target) documentation to explain the more standard and explicit form for specifying the search box `urlTemplate`. Google will still accept the shorthand form as noted.
  - Added a new optional property to the [Dataset documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset): `funder`.
- **June 10** : Deprecated the [critic
  review documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/critic-review). We initially tested critic review markup with a group of site owners, and ultimately found that it wasn't useful for the ecosystem at scale. This deprecation doesn't affect any other features on Google Search that use review markup. You can leave the markup on your site so that search engines can better understand your web page.
- **June 8** : Added [`BackOrder`](https://schema.org/BackOrder) as an allowed value for the `availability` property in [Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product).
- **June 4** : Added [`gtin`](https://schema.org/gtin) as an allowed identifier and clarified how to correctly use [`isbn`](https://schema.org/isbn) for [Product structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product).
- **June 3** : Added support for the [`inLanguage`](https://schema.org/inLanguage) property to the [Math solvers documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/math-solvers#math-solver).
- **June 1** :
  - Modified the [Math Solver developer
    documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/math-solvers#problem-type-definitions) to add six new [problem types.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/math-solvers#problem-type-definitions)
  - Updated the `DuplexWeb` user agent (in [Overview of Google crawlers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/overview-google-crawlers)) to use a more recent system and Chrome version.

### May 2021

- **May 18** :
  - Added [documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#key-moments) for [`SeekToAction` structured
    data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#seek), which is an alternative way to participate in the key moments feature. [`Clip`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#clip) structured data is now out of beta, and available to be used by any site.
  - Modified the [`JobPosting` region availability list](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-posting#region-availability) to include Austria and Denmark.
- **May 6** : Modified the [publisher
  logo requirements of AMP `Article`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/article#article-types) structured data to more accurately reflect that we understand both raw URLs as well as `ImageObject` markup.

### April 2021

- **April 19** : Added new documentation for how to [Get
  started with signed exchanges on Google Search](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/signed-exchange). Learn more about the [signed exchange (SXG)
  announcement in our blog post](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2021/04/more-details-page-experience#sxg).
- **April 8** : Added a new quality guideline to the [Discover documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/mobile/google-discover). Discover focuses on interest-based feeds (for example, articles and videos), and filters out content that might confuse readers (for example, Discover might not recommend job applications, petitions, forms, code repositories, or satirical content that's removed from its original context).
- **April 7** : Updated the [`Video`
  structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#thumbnail-url) to state that the `thumbnailUrl` property must use one of the [supported Google Images file
  formats](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/google-images#supported-image-formats). Previously, the documentation didn't include WebP and SVG.
- **April 1** : Clarified the [key
  moments feature](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video#key-moments). Google Search tries to automatically detect the segments in your video and show key moments to users, without any effort on your part. Alternatively, there are two ways that you can manually tell Google which timestamp and label to use: [`Clip` structured data](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#clip) and [updating the description
  of a YouTube video](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#best-practices-youtube).

  > [!NOTE]
  > Currently, Google is working with a wide range of providers to ensure that the use of `Clip` structured data works well at scale (our interest form is closed, as we have reached capacity). You're welcome to [read the documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#clip) and implement `Clip` structured data in advance. Keep in mind that Google doesn't guarantee that your structured data will show up in search results, even if your page is marked up correctly according to the Rich Results Test.

### March 2021

- **March 29** : Removed the interest form for the [Key moments feature](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/video#clips-example). The feature remains in development with a select group of providers, but the program is no longer accepting submissions.
- **March 25** : Added new structured data documentation for [practice problems](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/practice-problems) and [math solvers](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/math-solvers).
- **March 24** :
  - Based on user feedback, we added examples for the property `experienceRequirements.monthsOfExperience` in the [`JobPosting`
    structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-posting#education-and-experience-properties-beta).
  - Added a new optional property to the [Dataset documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/dataset): `isAccessibleForFree`.
- **March 17** : Updated the [video
  best practices](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/video) to more clearly emphasize the important guidelines. Removed duplicate content and updated the screenshots.
- **March 16** : Based on user feedback, we added more examples for the [`max-snippet` robots `meta` rule](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/robots/robots_meta_tag#all), and also specified for each tag what Google's default behavior is when the tags are omitted.
- **March 11** : Added new beta properties to the [`JobPosting`
  structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-posting#education-and-experience-properties-beta). You may not see any appearance or effect in Google Search right away, as we are still developing how we are using this information.
  - `educationRequirements.credentialCategory`
  - `experienceRequirements`
  - `experienceRequirements.monthsOfExperience`
  - `experienceInPlaceOfEducation`
- **March 8** : Added the `JP_E-CODE` value as an accepted value for the [`PropertyValue`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/book#propertyvalue-identifier) property in the [`Book`
  documentation.](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/book)
- **March 1** : Removed instructions for submitting sitemaps on Google Sites from the [sitemap guide](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/crawling-indexing/sitemaps/build-sitemap). Google Sites doesn't create a sitemap for sites anymore.

### February 2021

- **February 8** : Removed the page about joining the 3D and AR Early Adopters Program. The [feature](https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/9817187) remains in development with a select group of providers, but the program is no longer accepting submissions.
- **February 2**: Removed the documentation for cross-language search results. This page was specific to an experimental approach with a small group of providers, and we're removing the page because it's obsolete.

### January 2021

- **January 28** : Updated the [`Event` structured data documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/event) to state that the [`offers.priceCurrency`](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/event#offers-priceCurrency) property requires an ISO 4217 currency code.
- **January 22** : Added documentation for the [price drop enhancement](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/product#price-drop) for product rich results.
- **January 20** : Updated the [Job
  Training documentation](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/job-training) to clarify that the appearance isn't available on Google Search right now.
